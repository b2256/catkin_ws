NOTES 20180313
Testing from my laptop, running with real hardware attached in live (non-test) mode elicited a "permission denied" error on the OpenComport() API call.  Solved it with the following command followed by reboot:
sudo gpasswd --add ghedger dialout

Below is the working launch command with OBDII connected directly to laptop:
roslaunch obdii_interface obdii_interface.launch rs232_baud_rate:="115200" rs232_port:="/dev/ttyUSB0" obdii_polling_rate:="1"

launch file would not launch from ODRDOID; running
catkin_make install

Still no launch; added these lines to ~/.bashrc

export ROS_IP='127.0.0.1'
export ROS_HOSTNAME=$ROS_IP
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://$ROS_IP:11311
source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash


ODroid launches with this command:
roslaunch obdii_interface obdii_interface.launch

NOTES 20180314
Set default rs232_port param in launch file to "/dev/ttyUSB0".

Note that this will "float" depending on the final configuration.  Communicated this to client, with possible resolution.
