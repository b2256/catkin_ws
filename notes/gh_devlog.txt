Attempted to build with latest code pull from github.com/b2256; encountered build errros; installed following packages:
  ros-kinetic-driver-base
  ros-kinetic-camera1394
Cleaned up build environemnt: Added a .gitignore with the build/** and devel/** directories.

Set OBDII default polling rate to 10Hz in obdii_interface.launch.


=== Ladybug 6-way camera ===
Read LadyBug technical manual on interface
  - No compressed JPG image support on Linux; that's probably okay as we want the raw frames, which will be discarded once they're no longer needed in the pipeline.
  - GithubFlos/README.txt contains several disturbing references to "Windows" and "the windows pc running the ladybug grabber."  TODO: Will need to acquire raw image data from Ladybug and create a ROS receiver for this; need to cut off any and all dependencies upon Windows.
  - NOTE: Once we have image data will need to get bag data.

GOAL: Obtain raw image data in ROS bags from all six Ladybug cameras.

URDF MODEL: Want a sim w/Gazebo?

Firewire (1394b): 800Mbps (theoretical upper limit)
Framerate: 16 FPS w/JPEG compression, 6.5 FPS uncompressed.  Possible issue if Linux only supports uncompressed data...

Check into pointgrey_camera_driver:
http://wiki.ros.org/pointgrey_camera_driver
This looks very promising... Nope, after further evaluation, black-and-white or slow frame rate.

Must have:
  Image data
Nice-to-have / better framerate
  JPEG data
    * They seem to want to shove the user toward Windows for this (the slower operating system gets the faster frame rate).
    * A potential down side to JPEG would be the possible need to decompress later in the pipeline.  However, there may not be a need for this since the lasers are fully integrated with laser and their own camera; telemetric correlation data from GPS would then be sufficient to key the image...

==== Notes from discussion with Bruce ====

 - Sensor package:
   * 3 Sick lasers, which include integrated acquisition,
     - RS422 interface to central hub
   * accelerometer
   * GPS
     - Double feed: centeral hub and ladybug daemon)
 - No robot model yet, still putting all the pieces together.
 - Ladybug3 is least understood of all the components.
 - Need to find out if all six cameras can be set to trigger at same time.
 - Immediate first goal is to explore 1394 library for ladybug.
 - Detailed levels of scanning w/lasers and closer to survey grade models required only at intersections.  A key concern is position of curbs for truck turning radius.
 - Study Robot Localization, which gathers and normalizes all the sensor data.

Additional research into possible approaches.  Need to look at existing code before pulling in.

Pulled in Windows and Linux ladybug libraries

Spoke to Steven at FLIR to get the SDK download URL.  Confirmed that this SDK supports Ladybug3.  It is also no longer just for Windows.  Steven confirmed that, while FLIR does not officially support ROS, there is a large ROS community using their products.  Only Ubuntu 16.04 is officially supported.

Found SDK:
"This is the latest version of the Ladybug SDK which supports Ladybug2, Ladybug3, Ladybug5, and Ladybug5+. The initial Linux version of the Ladybug library supports both 1394 and USB3 cameras on Ubuntu 16.04 (both x86 and x86_64). The initial Linux SDK focuses on image acquisition, stream recording and GPS support via a command line application (LadybugRecorderConsole)."

Downloaded SDK from:

https://www.flir.com/support/products/ladybug-sdk#Resources

Installed:
sudo dpkg -i ladybug-1.16.3.48_amd64.deb



dependency error, missing xsdcxx
sudo apt install xsdcxx

NOTE: Add users using 1394 cards to pgrimaging group for correct permissions.
Added user "dev" to this group upon prompting from installer

Again, attempted to install SDK:
sudo dpkg -i ladybug-1.16.3.48_amd64.deb


Ladybug installed successfully.

LadyBugRecorderConsole runs, although no cameras are found.



moved ros-ladybug to src/ directory

catkin_make elicited

Nope.  However, we'll still need these libraries.

Back in project root (catkin_ws), catkin_make clean shows another slew of errors and warnings:

catkin_make fails with the following:

Removed "system_lib" dependencies from ros-ladybug/CMakeLists.txt and bag2orb/CMakeLists.txt.  This is intended to be an example, not a literal library (see https://answers.ros.org/question/288967/build-package-with-system_lib-not-found/)

Warning:

CMP0046 documentation:

	CMP0046
	-------

	Error on non-existent dependency in add_dependencies.

	CMake 2.8.12 and lower silently ignored non-existent dependencies
	listed in the ``add_dependencies()`` command.

	The OLD behavior for this policy is to silently ignore non-existent
	dependencies. The NEW behavior for this policy is to report an error
	if non-existent dependencies are listed in the ``add_dependencies()``
	command.

Not addressing at this time; possibly set the policy to OLD for now since this is only a warning, but this is not on critical path...

Commented out lines 149, 169, 225 of ros-ladybuf/CMakeLists.txt.  find -iname 'imageMessage.pb.cc' turned up nothing; why is a non-existent file being included? (Note: we may need to hunt this down later)

Error:

Install zmq lightweight messaging kernel:

zmq.h now present; check if it's a target link dependency; it is (CMakeLists.txt:158).

More comp.aints about the nonexistent protobuf/imageMessage.pb.h...  Need to find what this, where to get it, and why it's missing though referenced.  It's a generated file from Google Protocol Buffers; now how do we generate it?

Check if it's supposed to be generated as part of build process...

Maybe Google protobufs compiled from source was incorrect; README.txt only references "protobuff" [sic].

sudo apt install protobuf-compiler

Aha... It's a sub-repository in Git.  Copying off my ros-ladybug and re-cloning with this command.

git clone --recurse-submodules git://github.com/foo/bar.git

I don't want to use a "public key".  I want to be given the choice to enter a password and use the https portal...  However, in the interest of expediency, will attempt to add my github SSH key and clone that way.  Working, pulling objects... Completed...

src/ros-ladybug/src/common/protobuf now contains files...

	CMake Error at ros-ladybug/CMakeLists.txt:148 (add_library):
		Cannot find source file:

			src/common/protobuf/imageMessage.pb.cc

Okay, attempting to build the compiled imageMessage.pb.cc from imageMessage.proto manually -- COME BACK TO THIS; building should be one command eventually (catkin_make)....

After some digging:

protoc -I=. --cpp_out=. imageMessage.proto

Run this from src/ros-ladybug/src/common/protobuf.

Note, this will yield the following warning:

	[libprotobuf WARNING google/protobuf/compiler/parser.cc:637] No syntax specified for the proto file: imageMessage.proto. Please use 'syntax = "proto2";' or 'syntax = "proto3";' to specify a syntax version. (Defaulted to proto2 syntax.)

It's unclear, given the lack of documentation both online and in the repo around ros-ladybug, which syntax it prefers, so probably will have to do some trial-and-error.

New build errors -- lots of them:

/home/dev/git/obdii_ros/src/ros-ladybug/src/common/protobuf/imageMessage.pb.h:1821:30: error: expected ‘}’ before end of line

Errors extended past top of terminal buffer; rebuilt and got root:

/usr/include/c++/5/bits/c++0x_warning.h:32:2: error: #error This file requires compiler and library support for the ISO C++ 2011 standard. This support must be enabled with the -std=c++11 or -std=gnu++11 compiler options.

Added -std=c++11 to build options for ros-ladybug CMakeLists.txt:
	include(CheckCXXCompilerFlag)
	check_cxx_compiler_flag(-std=c++11 HAS_STD_CPP11_FLAG)
	if(HAS_STD_CPP11_FLAG)
		add_compile_options(-std=c++11)
	endif()


zmq is wrong version;

	sudo apt-remove

Verify that zmq.h is gone.  Now, reinstall it from a newer repo:

	echo "deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/network:/messaging:/zeromq:/release-stable/Debian_9.0/ ./" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
	wget https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/network:/messaging:/zeromq:/release-stable/Debian_9.0/Release.key -O- | sudo apt-key add
	apt-get install libzmq3-dev

(Ubuntu 16.04 is Debian 9)

And, play it again, Sam, to get the next spate of errors...

New error:

	/home/dev/git/obdii_ros/src/ros-ladybug/include/zmq.hpp:550:47: error: ‘zmq_event_t’ does not name a type
					 virtual void on_event_connected(const zmq_event_t &event_, const char* addr_) { (void

Investigating that...

Looks like it installed ZMQ 4.1.4.  Going to have to pull the source and include 3.2.5 (it doesn't have 3.2.4) explicitly.  Following instructions at http://zeromq.org/intro:get-the-software

Rather than re-installing an older version of ZMQ (which may actually break ROS), added an include directive in CMakeLists.txt:

	add_compile_options(-I=/home/dev/install/zeromq-3.2.5/include)

(NOTE, there's a hardcoded username, "dev" in that string; COME BACK TO THIS; baby steps)

We're passed the "error: 'zmq_event_t' does not name a type" errors; now the error is:

  /home/dev/git/obdii_ros/src/ros-ladybug/src/common/opencv_helper.cpp:34:9: error: ‘imdecode’ is not a member of ‘cv’

Suspecting this an OpenCV 2.4 vs. OpenCV 3 problem...  Possible answer here:

  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33707500/error-imread-is-not-a-member-of-cv

in ros-ladybug/include/opencv_helper.h, commented out opencv/cv.h and added opencv2/opencv.hpp

	// #include <opencv/cv.h>
	#include <opencv2/opencv.hpp>

Now build completed and erroring out on link:

  /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lzmq

Trying to put zmq back...

  sudo apt install libzmq3-dev

Build now completes to 84% then errors on link:

  CMakeFiles/service.dir/src/common/protobuf/imageMessage.pb.cc.o: In function `ladybug5_network::ImageType_descriptor()':
imageMessage.pb.cc:(.text+0x493): undefined reference to `google::protobuf::internal::AssignDescriptors(google::protobuf::internal::DescriptorTable const*)'

From https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/issues/3046

  sudo apt install --reinstall libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler

No dice, same error...
