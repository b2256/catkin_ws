=== Ladybug 6-way camera ===
Read LadyBug technical manual on interface
  - No compressed JPG image support on Linux; that's probably okay as we want the raw frames, which will be discarded once they're no longer needed in the pipeline.
  - GithubFlos/README.txt contains several disturbing references to "Windows" and "the windows pc running the ladybug grabber."  TODO: Will need to acquire raw image data from Ladybug and create a ROS receiver for this; need to cut off any and all dependencies upon Windows.
  - NOTE: Once we have image data will need to get bag data.

GOAL: Obtain raw image data in ROS bags from all six Ladybug cameras.

URDF MODEL: Want a sim w/Gazebo?

Firewire (1394b): 800Mbps (theoretical upper limit)
Framerate: 16 FPS w/JPEG compression, 6.5 FPS uncompressed.  Possible issue if Linux only supports uncompressed data...

Check into pointgrey_camera_driver:

This looks very promising... Nope, after further evaluation, black-and-white or slow frame rate.

Must have:
  Image data
Nice-to-have / better framerate
  JPEG data
    * They seem to want to shove the user toward Windows for this (the slower operating system gets the faster frame rate).
    * A potential down side to JPEG would be the possible need to decompress later in the pipeline.  However, there may not be a need for this since the lasers are fully integrated with laser and their own camera; telemetric correlation data from GPS would then be sufficient to key the image...

==== Notes from discussion with Bruce ====

 - Sensor package:
   * 3 Sick lasers, which include integrated acquisition,
     - RS422 interface to central hub
   * accelerometer
   * GPS
     - Double feed: centeral hub and ladybug daemon)
 - No robot model yet, still putting all the pieces together.
 - Ladybug3 is least understood of all the components.
 - Need to find out if all six cameras can be set to trigger at same time.
 - Immediate first goal is to explore 1394 library for ladybug.
 - Detailed levels of scanning w/lasers and closer to survey grade models required only at intersections.  A key concern is position of curbs for truck turning radius.
 - Study Robot Localization, which gathers and normalizes all the sensor data.

Additional research into possible approaches.  Need to look at existing code before pulling in.

Pulled in Windows and Linux ladybug libraries

Spoke to Steven at FLIR to get the SDK download URL.  Confirmed that this SDK supports Ladybug3.  It is also no longer just for Windows.  Steven confirmed that, while FLIR does not officially support ROS, there is a large ROS community using their products.  Only Ubuntu 16.04 is officially supported.

Found SDK:
"This is the latest version of the Ladybug SDK which supports Ladybug2, Ladybug3, Ladybug5, and Ladybug5+. The initial Linux version of the Ladybug library supports both 1394 and USB3 cameras on Ubuntu 16.04 (both x86 and x86_64). The initial Linux SDK focuses on image acquisition, stream recording and GPS support via a command line application (LadybugRecorderConsole)."

Downloaded SDK from:

https://www.flir.com/support/products/ladybug-sdk#Resources

Installed:
sudo dpkg -i ladybug-1.16.3.48_amd64.deb

dependency error, missing xsdcxx
sudo apt install xsdcxx

NOTE: Add users using 1394 cards to pgrimaging group for correct permissions.
Added user "dev" to this group upon prompting from installer

Again, attempted to install SDK:
sudo dpkg -i ladybug-1.16.3.48_amd64.deb


Ladybug installed successfully.

LadyBugRecorderConsole runs, although no cameras are found.

Not addressing at this time; possibly set the policy to OLD for now since this is only a warning, but this is not on critical path...

Commented out lines 149, 169, 225 of ros-ladybuf/CMakeLists.txt.  find -iname 'imageMessage.pb.cc' turned up nothing; why is a non-existent file being included? (Note: we may need to hunt this down later)

	CMake Error at ros-ladybug/CMakeLists.txt:148 (add_library):

Okay, attempting to build the compiled imageMessage.pb.cc from imageMessage.proto manually -- COME BACK TO THIS; building should be one command eventually (catkin_make)....

After some digging:

protoc -I=. --cpp_out=. imageMessage.proto

Run this from src/ros-ladybug/src/common/protobuf.

Note, this will yield the following warning:

	[libprotobuf WARNING google/protobuf/compiler/parser.cc:637] No syntax specified for the proto file: imageMessage.proto. Please use 'syntax = "proto2";' or 'syntax = "proto3";' to specify a syntax version. (Defaulted to proto2 syntax.)

It's unclear, given the lack of documentation both online and in the repo around ros-ladybug, which syntax it prefers, so probably will have to do some trial-and-error.

New build errors -- lots of them:

And, play it again, Sam, to get the next spate of errors...

New error:

					 virtual void on_event_connected(const zmq_event_t &event_, const char* addr_) { (void

Investigating that...

Looks like it installed ZMQ 4.1.4.  Going to have to pull the source and include 3.2.5 (it doesn't have 3.2.4) explicitly.  Following instructions at http://zeromq.org/intro:get-the-software

Rather than re-installing an older version of ZMQ (which may actually break ROS), added an include directive in CMakeLists.txt:

	add_compile_options(-I=/home/dev/install/zeromq-3.2.5/include)

(NOTE, there's a hardcoded username, "dev" in that string; COME BACK TO THIS; baby steps)

We're passed the "error: 'zmq_event_t' does not name a type" errors; now the error is:

  /home/dev/git/obdii_ros/src/ros-ladybug/src/common/opencv_helper.cpp:34:9: error: ‘imdecode’ is not a member of ‘cv’

Suspecting this an OpenCV 2.4 vs. OpenCV 3 problem...  Possible answer here:

  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33707500/error-imread-is-not-a-member-of-cv

in ros-ladybug/include/opencv_helper.h, commented out opencv/cv.h and added opencv2/opencv.hpp

	// #include <opencv/cv.h>
	#include <opencv2/opencv.hpp>

Now build completed and erroring out on link:

Uninstalled libprotobuf-dev, which completely wiped out ROS because of dependencies.  Thus, we know that ROS depends on the latest version of protobuf.  Re-evaluating: instead of shoehorning the world to fit ros-ladybug, we'll go the other way...

Reinstalled ROS cleanly, and zmq-dev.  First target is ros-ladybug/include/zmq.hpp...

This is taking too long, and there's no guarantee Ladybug5 for which this was written can be downshifted to Ladybug3.  Going to switch to looking at camera1394 again.

Working on calling the SetRegistersRequest services on camera1394.

From https://github.com/ros-drivers/camera1394/pull/32:

  Possible implementation (draft) of #30.

  Other dc1394_get/set_register(s) functions could be wrapped in a similar way. The messages are generic to be used with all of them.

  I tested it on Ubuntu 12.04/Hydro with Ladybug 3, selecting/querying sensors (side cameras, top camera) participating in auto exposure using

  rosservice call /camera/set_camera_registers "{type: 0, offset: 0x1E90, value: [0b111110]}"
  rosservice call /camera/set_camera_registers "{type: 0, offset: 0x1E90, value: [0b000001]}"
  rosservice call /camera/get_camera_registers "{type: 0, offset: 0x1E90, num_regs: 1}"

  and selecting/querying images for transmission (all cameras, side cameras).

  rosservice call /camera/set_camera_registers "{type: 0, offset: 0x1E88, value: [0xffffff]}"
  rosservice call /camera/set_camera_registers "{type: 0, offset: 0x1E88, value: [0xfffff0]}"
  rosservice call /camera/get_camera_registers "{type: 0, offset: 0x1E88, num_regs: 1}"

Working on plumbing for ros::service calls...  Documentation is minimal, but the header files are readily available under /opt/ros/kinetic/camera1394.

Distilled down from the heavy C++ templating, a request contains type, offset, value, and mode.  Value is not a simple scalar integer, but a vector of uint13_t, perhaps for serial writing of values to the same offset.

Planning for camera data stream:

* Ladybug image grab
* camera1394 nodelet
* Decompression (JPEG -> Raw)
* Color processing (Bayer)
* undistort (rectification; will need lens K and D calibration coefficients; does it exist or do we need to create them using the chessboard and undistort?
* stitch (see /usr/src/ladybug/src/ladybugPanoStitchExample/ladybugPanoStitchExample.cpp)
* projection

Variables:
* Are we running 1394b (800Mb/S) or 1394a (400Mb/S)?  This will affect our frame rate.  Assuming it's the IEEE-1394b ExpressCard for notebooks that comes with the development kit (p. 26).
* Drive throughput will also affect performance.  The Technical Reference recommends a striped RAID array, the lack of which is a potential bottleneck...
* We can power the camera using VExt (Pin 7 on the Hirose HR25 connector, 8-30VDC) (p. 28) and direct connection to the vehicle's power supply (typically 12-14VDC).

Created a new ladybug3camera project using camera1394stereo as a base, with intent to 1) elminate unwanted "stereo" features; and 2) add the necessary Ladybug3-specific features (like Mode 7)

Add include directories for Ladybug SDK

Investigated whether registers can be written more directly than with the ros::service call..  In this investigation, noted that the camera1394stereo package was authored in 2011 while the ros::service calls for setting registers was not added until mid-2014.

OBDII:
Looked into possible cause of OBDII issues.
From Linux man pages for read():
  RETURN VALUE         top

       On success, the number of bytes read is returned (zero indicates end
       of file), and the file position is advanced by this number.  It is
       not an error if this number is smaller than the number of bytes
       requested; this may happen for example because fewer bytes are
       actually available right now (maybe because we were close to end-of-
       file, or because we are reading from a pipe, or from a terminal), or
       because read() was interrupted by a signal.  See also NOTES.

If there's ever a situation where the bytes available is smaller than the an_decoder packet size, could result in data left over from previous read.  TODO: Check this when on site: add a trigger for byte size less than total packet size.

Pivoting back to image pipeline, with intent to find out in the new camera1394-based "ladybug3camera3camera3camera" package, the code where the data is actually pulled from the 1394 into the buffer.  From there, we'll look at jpeg decompression.  Also continuing to explore the LadybugSDK; still have not found any linkable libraries -- where are they?

Libraries are here:
	./usr/lib/ladybug/libladybug.so.1.16.3.48
	./usr/lib/ladybug/libladybug.so.1
	./usr/lib/ladybug/libladybug.so

Incision point for JPEG decompression found driver1394stereo.cpp:296 just prior to publication.

Need rosbridge for image publication per https://answers.ros.org/question/99831/publish-file-to-image-topic/

  sudo apt install ros-kinetic-rosbridge-*

I want to be able to see the realtime image with image_view as this will be important for testing/debugging.

Investigated the camera1394stereo_nodelet.xml, which seems to elicit problems at runtime.  Why is this necessary, and is it still necessary in Kinetic?  It's necessary to run the node as a nodelet, which "designed to provide a way to run multiple algorithms in the same process with zero copy transport between algorithms" (http://wiki.ros.org/nodelet).  Looks like it's not being installed.  Added to CMakeLists.txt, to install in the install/share directory.

ladybug3camera now launches, emitting the expected error opening port, since no camera is connected in the current environment.

Changed topic names from 'stereo_camera' to 'ladybug3_camera' - leaving the underscore deliberately for string/context disambiguation.

Note on Ladybug3 image pipeline philosophy: the camera firmware relies on image compression to overcome the bottleneck of the 1394b 800Mbps interface.  This, however, imposes a slight processing burden on the software running on the host to then decompress these images for display.  It will prove desirable to monitor unstitched images as part of the pipeline for realtime monitoring of the system (i.e. is it running and recording data?).

Onsite, ran through camera connectivity checks.  Verified operational under Windows; found we were using wrong PCIe slot.  Attempting to run LadyBugRecorderConsole on Linux failed.  Attempting to get ladybug3camera ros nodelet running as this will afford a finer grain of control over the camera registers.

10:43 a.m.: Achieved output from camera.  It is not correct image data, but this is expected as the image data is in JPEG format.  We will need to extract the JPEG...  Want to see if I can run camera directly from my development system...

Attempted to run virtualization of PCI from host; not worth the effor, per https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch09.html#pcipassthrough.  Would need to install full ROS stack on host.  Abandoning this effort for now.

Looking into compressed_image_transport.

13:00 Contiued in ladybug3camera pipeline changing over image publication to compressed image publication.



Began down path of changing:
sensor_msgs::Image& ---> sensor_msgs::CompressedImage&
sensor_msgs::ImagePtr() ---> sensor_msgs::CompressedImagePtr()
image_transport::ImageTransport --> compressed_image_transport::CompressedPublisher

Also had to comment out references to image.width and image.height since CompressedImage lacks these (impossible to know without decompressing the image).

Came across the exact unanswered problem described here:
http://ros-users.122217.n3.nabble.com/Publishing-jpeg-images-directly-from-a-webcam-td3018614.html
The real challenges seem to begin when it comes to publishing the compressed image: from http://wiki.ros.org/image_transport/Tutorials/WritingNewTransport
Looks like a ROS hack...  "Why this indirection? It turns out that in ROS there are two distinct ways to publish messages to a subscriber. The normal way is to broadcast a message to all subscribers; the other way, seldom used, is to publish a message to a single subscriber within a subscriber status callback. SimplePublisherPlugin performs some tricky plumbing to use our implementation of publish() in both cases."

Not sure how far we want to go down this path as it's nonstandard -- words like "to a single publisher" make me very nervous as that's a clue to a deviation from standard ROS behavior -- but will continue investigating.

Decided to save off the work and instead look at decompressing the JPEG into standard raw, uncompressed format and shoehorn it into standard image_transport constructs.

Investigated ros-opencv bridge.  Began with attempt to get this code to compile in-situ to validate dependency satisfaction: http://docs.ros.org/jade/api/compressed_image_transport/html/compressed__publisher_8cpp_source.html  ; if we could get it to compress to jpg in situ, we could decompress as well.

There is an element of added complexity owing to the fact that, at the time the above-referenced code was written, OpenCV2 was standard whereas now, the cv:: namespace has become cv2::, with only some select pieces of OpenCV2.

Now, attempting decode.  CV_LOAD_IMAGE_COLOR has been replaced by IMREAD_COLOR.  Dealt with Image vs ImagePtr vs ImagePtr& deferencing issues in the method signatures and calls.

Investigating libjpeg to try to extract the data directly, bypassing opencv altoegher (which uses it).  Using OpenCV elicits an error.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15101281/libjpeg-api-and-reference

Fixed crash (shared_ptr scoping issue).

More unraveling of the image pipeline challenges.  Achieved what is purported to be decompression of a JPEG.  Images appear, but they are in the wrong places and jump around, indicating the unpacking is starting at the wrong place.

Spending too much time waiting for the console computer in the Jeep.  Limited memory makes it difficult to run a browser and ROS (runs out of memory and segfaults on larger image sizes).  Would be very convenient and more efficient to be able to instrument the console desktop remotely, so spent 1/2 hour investigating remote desktop; set it up with VNC server and tightvnc; found that network security does not permit computers on the guest network to connect to each other.

As a secondary option, wrote out several JPEG frames as binary.  Found that the actual JPEG data starts at byte offset 0x0400 (1024), in modes 0 and 3.

The mode 0 output showed two (two) JPEG headers, and the mode 3 (three) showed 7 in one case and 8 in another.  Was unable to obtain more than one mode 0 frame since further downstream it crashes the whole system (too big? wrong dimensions somewhere?)

Two mode 7 files featured 11 and 10 JPEG headers.  The nature of the data in the file changes abruptly at 0x2f9a50 and 0x2f9730 respectively, indicating a transition from compressed imagery (JPEG) to exif, lens intrinsics, and other data.  The imagery component comprises a small minority of the data of each frame.

In summary, it's clear that the Ladybug frame output is highly proprietary.

We will be looking more deeply into the SDK and the autoware Ladybug implementations.  Autoware will require newer hardware: they recommend at least 8 cores, 32GB RAM (my development workstation has only 16GB).

Began the process of satisfying dependencies to build autoware.
